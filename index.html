                        The idea behind Micro Frontend is to splicing of website into independent modules
                        on the basis of different features. We have different features like attendance, payroll, leave in linckia. 
                        If we divide linckia into seperate independent project on the basis of feature then we have micro frontend architecture.

                   There are times when it becomes absolutely neccessary to rewrite whole codebase. Maybe current technology becomes deprecrated or maybe
                   it's not popular anymore so it's not easy to find developers who can work on it or maybe current technology not suited for problem we trying to solve.
                   But if we change technology of project having large codebase then it will take huge effort and time.
                   As it happens when we switch from angularjs to Angular 2.

                  It's not easy to upgrade a project when different teams working on same codebase. When I was ugrading angular 5
                  to angular 7 there were lots of issues coming because other teams pushing code parallely. So as I was giving new release
                  then new bugs comes up. Also I had made changes in around 300 files so it was very difficult to review and test it.

                     There may be so many things which is not used but still be part of our codebase. It's not easy to clean codebase when
                     you have large codebase and modules are too tightly coupled with each other. Our technical debt keep on increasing.

                        In Micro frontend web apps are distributed in small chunks of services starting from the UI to database that works independently. 
                        So, even if one feature faces the issue, it doesn’t affect the rest of the web app. 
                        And this feature makes it possible to recover from the error faster.

                        The source code for each individual micro frontend will by definition be much smaller than the source code of a single monolithic frontend.

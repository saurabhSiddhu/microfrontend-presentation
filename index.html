                      In the beginning, we have monolithic system where everything is bundled up inside a single deployable 
                      unit. This monolithic used backend templating engine like freemarkup and jquery for ui. The system
                      is highly coupled. 
                      As SPA become popular we split big monolithic into two parts front-end and backend. Now we have front-end team and backend team
                      which working with more focussed view of app and code became more maintainable.
                      But as application grows bigger and complex it became not feasable to build everything in single project so we divided  backend into small services.
                      In all these common is front-end remain monolithic. In recent time the frontend layer became more and more sophisticated. User expect more interactive 
                      experinces. We don't have mechanism for dealing with it. This is where Microfrontend comes in.

                        The idea is to think about a website as a composition of features. 
                        On the basis of these feature, front-end app is decomposed into individual, semi-independent “microapps” which are loosely coupled.
                        Each microapp can be managed by a independent team.  Each team has a distinct area of business or mission it cares about and specialises in. 
                        A team is cross functional and develops its features end-to-end, from database to user interface.

                        The Microfrontend  architecture tackles the problem of productivity and speed by decomposing applications into manageable chunks that are faster to develop. 
                        Since teams are autonomous therefore different teams can be working on different components simultaneously without having to waiting for other team to finish  work before starting theirs.

                  When we opens attendance page, we loads all components, service, css . This is huge performance

                  proper mechanism for loading resourse. But as Microfrontend architecture divide our codebase into chunks it would be easier for us to acheive it.

                    So code readablity keeps on decreasing with time. Howerver in Microfrontend, as teams are working on independent microapp , it would
                    be easy to enforce coding standards across the app.

                  It's not easy to upgrade a project when different teams working on same codebase and we have huge codebase . When I was ugrading angular 5
                  to angular 7 there were lots of issues coming because other teams pushing code parallely. 
                  Also I had made changes in around 300 files so it was very difficult to review and test.
                  Since in Microfrontend code divided into small chunks , it is easy to upgrade

                    It may happen if someone has written bad code then it may effect whole project. But In Micro frontend web apps are distributed in small chunks of services starting from the UI to database that works independently. 
                    So, even if one feature faces the issue, it doesn’t affect the rest of the web app. 
                    And this also makes possible to recover from the error faster.

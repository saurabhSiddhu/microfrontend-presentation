                    The idea behind Micro Frontend is to splicing of website into independent modules
                    on the basis of different features. We have different features like attendance, payroll, leave in linckia. 
                    If we divide linckia into seperate independent project on the basis of feature then we have micro frontend architecture.

                  It's not easy to upgrade a project when different teams working on same codebase. When I was ugrading angular 5
                  to angular 7 there were lots of issues coming because other teams pushing code parallely. So as I was giving new release
                  then new bugs comes up. Also I had made changes in around 300 files so it was very difficult to review and test it.

                     This is GtLoginFormComponent. No one is using it right now. But it is still part of linckia's build.
                     There may be so many things which is not used but still be part of our codebase. It's not easy to clean codebase when
                     you have large codebase and modules are too tightly coupled with each other. Our technical debt keep on increasing.

                        Instead of huge holistic codes, the code-base is distributed according to the feature and functionality and a specific team maintains them.
                        This makes it easier to maintain the app.

                    <aside>
                        In Micro frontend web apps are distributed in small chunks of services starting from the UI to database that works independently. 
                        So, even if one feature faces the issue, it doesn’t affect the rest of the web app. 
                        And this feature makes it possible to recover from the error faster.

                    <aside>
                        The source code for each individual micro frontend will by definition be much smaller than the source code of a single monolithic frontend. 
                        These smaller codebases tend to be simpler and easier for developers to work with.

                        You do know by now that each micro frontend can be written using a different technology. 
                        This simplifies the selection of the most appropriate tech stack for the specific needs of your service.
